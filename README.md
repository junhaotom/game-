Big picture
I try to do a time bomb for my possible project. I want this project to be the game of guessing the password of the bomb. The bomb will explode if you still don’t get the right password until the end of the time.

First Round
1.The program will ask you to guess the password for the bomb.
2.If your answer is smaller than the password, the program will tell you “Hint: too small”.
3.If your answer is bigger than the password, the program will tell you “Hint: too big”. 
4.You have 100 seconds to guess the password.
5.If you guess the right answer, you win!

Reflections and revisions
I don’t know how to get the two programs(bomb and timer) together. Maybe I should make some functions for that.

Next steps
I have to fix this problem but I’m not quite sure how to do it. I think I need to put the timer in the bomb’s loop.
